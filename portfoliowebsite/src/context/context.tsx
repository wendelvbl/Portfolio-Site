Some of the key tasks I worked on included generating JWT tokens, saving them to a database, and using a CRON job for the first time to send emails. I also authenticated those tokens when they were used. One major takeaway is that I need to focus more on testing. I wrote too much code before verifying that everything worked as expected, which led to me spending three-quarters of Wednesday debugging. All in all, a successful week!",

I also designed an email layout for a mail, which was a fun challenge. On the backend, I created a POST API controller, making sure everything worked smoothly. Another big highlight was working with Redux, a state management tool that helped streamline data flow in my project. One key takeaway is that proper state management can make a huge difference in maintaining clean and efficient code. Overall, a productive and insightful week!",
