Some of the key tasks I worked on included generating JWT tokens, saving them to a database, and using a CRON job for the first time to send emails. I also authenticated those tokens when they were used. One major takeaway is that I need to focus more on testing. I wrote too much code before verifying that everything worked as expected, which led to me spending three-quarters of Wednesday debugging. All in all, a successful week!",

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the progress so far: Monday (3/03): We focused on refactoring the backend and optimizing queries related to freelancers. Additional data for the previous month was added to emails and the front-end. We also created a new API endpoint and service to allow manual token generation. Tuesday (4/03): The front-end underwent a major refactoring to align with the new backend changes. Work continued on the query for manually requesting tokens, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we conducted a code review to maintain clean and maintainable code. Wednesday (5/03): A new modal was introduced, allowing users to request tokens manually. This required adding an extra form in the front-end and creating a dedicated route for processing requests. Middleware was also implemented to handle authentication and validation. The front-end modal design was finalized to ensure a smooth user experience. Thursday (6/03): Work continued on the extra modal route, refining its functionality and integrating it with the back-end. Additionally, we implemented email notifications for token requests. The controller and route handling these requests were completed, ensuring that tokens could be issued efficiently. These improvements will provide freelancers with a smoother, more flexible way to manage tokens while keeping the system scalable and maintainable. ðŸš€"
